<!-- About Me -->
<p align="center">
    Hello! I love computers and programming. I found an interest in computer science during middle school, starting with robotics and the world of Microsoft. I started programming seriously in 10th grade. I am in my 11th grade year, with an avid interest in both Python and C++. I hold two industry-based certifications: CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+) and CIW Network Technology Associate. Asides from CS, I also enjoy physics and mathematics. Thank you for getting to know me and happy coding!
